librsvg-og
==========

This is librsvg-og (read: librsvg "old gen") - A small library to render
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). It has been created as a fork of the original
librsvg of version 2.40.20, which was the last stable release untainted by rust
additions. librsvg-og performs the same task as the original librsvg, to render
SVG files to Cairo surfaces, and should be a drop-in replacement for librsvg,
assuming no API-breaking changes by upstream.

The goal of this fork is to keep the C implementation alive and up to date, to
help provide librsvg for platforms without a working rust compiler.

Reporting bugs
--------------

Please report bugs at https://github.com/oaken-source/librsvg-og/issues

If you want to report a rendering bug, or a missing SVG feature,
please provide an example SVG file as an attachment to your bug
report.  It really helps if you can minimize the SVG to only the
elements required to reproduce the bug or see the missing feature, but
it is not absolutely required.  Please be careful of publishing SVG
images that you don't want other people to see; the bug tracker is a
public resource and attachments are visible to everyone.
